This is a first pass at supporting Avro data within pure JavaScript. The intent here is for this to be used within a web browser, so the focus will be on decoding Avro data at first with encoding to come in the future.

Feel free to fork this repository and submit changes back to me (Bruce Mitchener).

 * Better testing arrangement.
 * Automate test running in the build.xml
 * Can Ivy or Ant download the Closure compiler for us rather than including it?
 * Look at switching the UTF-8 decoding over to using decodeURIComponent.
 * Finish implementing the basic types:
   * Floats
   * Doubles
 * Test more things, like:
   * More ranges of numbers, including 64 bit values.
   * UTF-8 encoded string with both European languages and Eastern languages.
 * Look at switching over to the advanced compilation mode for the Closure compiler.
 * Start adding hire level layers of decoding, like record, enum, etc and the ability to use schemas.
 * When this is closer to being useful:
   * Get into the main Avro SVN repository.
   * Get a JIRA component for this.
   * Documentation...
