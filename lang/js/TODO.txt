 * Better testing arrangement.
 * Automate test running in the build.xml
 * Set up Ivy or whatever to autodownload the Closure compiler?
 * Look at switching the UTF-8 decoding over to using decodeURIComponent.
 * Finish implementing the basic types:
   * Floats
   * Doubles
 * Test more things, like:
   * More ranges of numbers, including 64 bit values.
   * UTF-8 encoded string with both European languages and Eastern languages.
 * Look at switching over to the advanced compilation mode for the Closure compiler.
 * Start adding hire level layers of decoding, like record, enum, etc and the ability to use schemas.
 * When this is closer to being useful:
   * Get into the main Avro SVN repository.
   * Get a JIRA component for this.
   * Documentation...
